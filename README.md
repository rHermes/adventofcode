# Advent of code

My solutions, in various languages, mostly python.

I write more detailed notes in the commit messages!

## Task notes

### 2019

#### 12

I got frustrated and read the hint that the axis are independent. Felt bad
about this one, since I could have puzzled this out, but I guess I learned
a lesson about what the real fun is.

#### 16

Had to get a hint about area summation tables to finish it.

#### 18

Had to copy a solution to get it done. Learned a lot.

#### 22

Had to get the explanation about how it worked from redditor. Learned a lot
by doing this.
